  4years of experience in the banking industry.Proven ability

<p>I am trying to change career from customer service advisor to a 
  frontend Developer and have been learning html, css and javascript
  and am actually enjoying it and is also fun to me. It is actually a 
  great priviledge learning new things and observing how I have been able 
  to understand some of the concept in learning programming
</p>

<p>These few months have been learning how to program, I realized it requires 
  patience, time and also dedication and the continuos getting stuck 
  and still be able to go over the topics and understand it. I have come 
  to realized if you want to be a good programmer, you must be able to
  unlearn, relearn and learn again.
